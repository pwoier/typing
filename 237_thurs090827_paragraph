Difference between Broadband and Baseband Transmission
In communication system, Broadband and Baseband refer to two different ways of transmitting data. They differ in how data is sent over a communication medium, the frequency range to two different ways of transmitting daya. They differ in how data is sent over a communication medium, the frequency range they use, and their applications. Broadand systems use modulation techniques to reduce the effect of noise in the environment. Broadband transmission employs multiple channel undirectional transmission using a combination of phase and amplitude modulation. Baseband is a digital signal transmitted on the medium using one of the signal codes like NRZ, RZ Mancheser biphase M code, etc. called baseband transmission.
