If you want to exclude anything tagged with notifications, you can use skip tags.
This is incredibly handy if you have a decent tagging structure when you want to only run a particular portion of a playbook, or one play in a series or alternatively, if you want to exclude a play or included tasks, then its easy to do using tags or skip tags
There is one caveat when adding one or multiple tags using the tags option in a playbook you can use shorthand tags tagname when adding just one tag, but if adding more than one tag, you have to use YAMLs list syntax, for example.
In general, I tend to use tags for larger playbooks, especially with individual roles and plays, but unsless Im debugging a set of tasks I generally avoid adding tags to individual tasks or includes not adding tags everywhere reduces visual clutter. You will need to find a tagging style that suits your needs and let you run or not run the specific parts of your playbooks you desire.
Blocks
Introduced in Ansible, Blocks allow you to handle errors inside the blocks in a way similar to most programming languages exception handling.
Heres an example playbook that uses blocks with when to run group of tasks specific to one platform without when parameters on each task
