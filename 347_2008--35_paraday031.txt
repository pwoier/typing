Capistrano style and blue green deployments
Many developers who deal with Ruby applications are familiar with Capistrano., a ra task automation and application deployment application build with Ruby. Capistranos basic style of deployment is to create dated release directories, then symlink the current release into a stable application directory, along with resources that are continuous among releases like logs and uploaded files.
Capistrano does a lot more than that basic deployment model, but am many people want to replicate a simple application deployment workflow which also makes rollbacks easy , since you just revert the symlink to the previous release directory. This is easy to do with Ansible, and rather than walk you through the entire process in this book, i I will point uou lyou you to a few great resources and an e aAnsible CGalaxy role that coordinates Capistrano style deployments with ease
