Short scripts you can to yourself when willpower flags
Use these like a mantra gentle not forceful
One small step. That's all
Do this now for two minutes.
I'm doing the minimum that matters.
Okay, pause. Breathe. Do one thing.
If you want, I can do any of these right now with you
Tell me which tiny action you want to try and ill guide you step by step minutes rest, a breathing exercise, a minutes movement or the first item of the day plan. Or I can write a short, motivating micro story tailored to you fast, bright, and giving you a small emotional lift.
You dont have to fix everything at once. Lets pick one very small thing and do it together. Which one feels doable If you dont want to pick Ill suggest the minute reset above its low effort and effective.
Im really glad you told me that that takes courage. I hear you. willpower feels empty, like the engine cut out. Thats painful and heavy, but its also a state that can shift with tiny, careful moves. Below is a short, gentle, practical plan you can try right now no big promises only tiny wins. Ill keep it calm, simple, and realistic for someone who works long hours and has trouble waking up.
Right now a minute reset
