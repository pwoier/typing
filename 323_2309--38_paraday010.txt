If you run the same playbook again, it should report no changes the entire playbook is idempotent You might be starting to see just how powerful it is to have a tool as flexible as Ansible at you disposal not only can you configure servers, you can create them singly, or dozens at a time, and configure them at once. And even if a ham fisted sysadmin jumps in and deletes an entire server, you can run the playbook again, and rest assured your server will be recreated and reconfigured exactly as it was when it was first set up.
Note that you might need to disable strict host key checking to get provisioning and instant configuration to work correctly, otherwise you may run into an error stating that Ansible cant connect to the new droplet during the second play. To do this, add the line host key checking False under the section in your ansible.cfg file located in etc ansible by default.
You should normally leave host key checking enabled, but when rapidly building and destroying VMs for testing purposes, it is simplest to disable it temporarily.
DigitalOcean dynamic inventory with digital ocean.py
Once you have some DigitalOcean droplets, you need a way for Ansible to dynamically build an inventory of your servers so you can built playbooks and use the servers in logical groupings or run playbooks and ansible commands directly on all droplets.
