Many developers who deal with Ruby applications are familiar with Capistrano , a task automation and applicarion application deployment application built with Ruby. Campi Capistranos basic style of deployment is to create dated release directoriers directories, then symlink the current release into a stable application directory, ali along with resources that are continuous among releases like logs and uploaded files. Capistrano does a lot more than that basic deployment model, but many pep people want to replicate a simple application deployment workflow which also makes rollbacks easy, since you just revert the symlink to the previous release directory. This is easy to do with Ansible, and rather than walk you through the entire process in this book, ill point you  to a few great resources and an Ansible Galaxy role that coordinates Capistrano style deployments with ease
