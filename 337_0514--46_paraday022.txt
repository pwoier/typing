if youve structured your playbooks so they have no or limited dependencies, you could test each role individually in a fresh virtual machine, before you use the role as part of a full infrastructure deployment.
Functional testing involves the whole shebang. Basically, you set up a complete infrastructure eb environment, and then u run tests against it to make sure everything was successfully installed, deployed, and configured, . Ansibles owen reporting is helpful in this kind of testing, and there are external tools available to test  infrastructure even more deeply.
It is ogte often possible to perform all the testing you need on your own local workstation, using Virtual Macth Machines as demonstrated in earlier chal chal cah cha; chapters , using tools il like VirtualBox or B VMWare. And with most cloud services providing robust control APIs and houlr hourly biling billing, its inexpensive just as fast to test directly on cloud instances mirroring your production infrastructure
Well behi behi behi behg begin with the most bo basic h th test s tests use using Ansible, along with common debugging techniques, then process to full fledged functional testing methos methd methods you with an automated o process.
