Ansible uses an inventory file basically a list of servers to communicate with your servers. Like a hosts file at etc hosts that matches IP addresses to domain names, an Ansible inventory file matches servers IP addresses or domain names to groups. Inventory files can do a lot more, but for now, well just create a simple file with one server. Create a file at etc ansible hosts the default location for Ansibles inventory file, and add one server to it.
sudo mkdir etc ansible
sudo touch etc ansible hosts
Edit this hosts file with nano, vim, or whatever editor youd like, but note youll need to edit it with sudo as root. Put the following into the file
www.example.com
where example is the group of servers youre managing and www.example.com is the domain name or IP address ofa server in that group. If youre not using port for SSH on this server, you will need to add it to the address, like www.example.com ,since Ansible defaults to port and wont get this value from your ssh config file.
This first example assumes you have a server set up that you can test with if you dont already have a spare server somewhere that you can connect to, you might want to create a small VM using DigitalOcean, Amazon Web Services, Linose or some other service that billed a few pennies.
Replace the www.example.com in the above example with the name or IP address of your server.
