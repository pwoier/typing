Ansible workd well with any servr to which you can connect remote or local. For speedier testing and development of Ansible playbooks, and for testing in general, its a very good idea to work locally. Local development and testing of infrastructure is both safer and faster than doing it on remote live machines especially in production enviroments.
In the past decade, test driven development TDD, in one form or another, has become the norm for much of the software industry. Infrastructure development hasnt been as organized until recently, and best practices dictate that infrastructure which is becoming more and more important to the software that runs on it should be thoroughly tested as well.
