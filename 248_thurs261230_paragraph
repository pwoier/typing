who is this book for
Many of the developers and sysadmins I work with are at least moderately comfortable administering a Linux server via SSH, and manage between servers.
Some of these people have a little experience with configuration management tools usually with Puppet or Chef, and maybe a little experience with deployments and continuous integration using Preface
tools like Jenkins, Capistrano, or Fabric. I am writing this book for these friends who, I think, are representative of most people who have heard of and or are beginning to use Ansible.
If you are interested in both decelopment and operations, and have at least a passing familiarity with managing a server via the command line, this book should provide you with an intermediate to expert level understanding of Ansible and how you can use it to manage your infrastructure.
Typographic conventions
Ansible uses a simple syntax YAML and simple command line tools
