Computer Network Tutorial
A Computer Network is a system where two or more devices are linked together to share data, resources, and information. These networks can range from simple setups, like connecting two devices in your home, to massive global systems, like the Internet.
Computer networks are an essential part of our daily
Basics of Computer Networking
A computer network is a collection of interconnected devices that share resources and information. These devices can include computers, servers, printers, and other hardware. Networks allow for the efficient exchange of data, enabling various applications such as email, file sharing, and internet browsing.
This article will explore the basics of computer networking, including network types, components, protocols, and essential services like Domain Name System DNS.
How Does a Computer Network Works
Basics building blocks of a Computer network are Nodes and Links. A Network Node can be illustrated as Equipment for Data Communication like a Modem, Router, etc., or Equipment of a Data Terminal like connecting two computers or more. Link in Computer Networks can be defined as wires or cables or free space of wireless networks.
The working of Computer Networks can be simply defined as rules or protocold which help in sending and receiving data via the links which allow Computer networks to communicate. Each device has an IP Address, that helps in identifying a device.
What do Computer Networks do?
Computer networks first developed in for military and defence purpose. At that time they are mainly used to send data through telephone lines and had limited use in business or science.
Today computer networks are essential for businesses also. Modern networks offer more than just connecting devices. They play a key role in helping businesses adapt to the digital world and succeed. These networks have become more flexible, automated, and secure, making them even more important in todays business environment.
Modern computer networks can
Work Virtually The physical network can be divided into smaller virtual networks. In these virtual networks, devices are connected and can send data through multiple physical routes. For example, many business networks use the internet this way.
Connect on a Large Scale Modern networks link many smaller, spread out networks into one big, powerful system. Automation and monitoring tools help manage and adjust the network as needed, allowing it to grow or shrink based on demand.
Adapt Quickly Many networks are controlled by software, so changes can be made quickly through a digital dashboard. This allows traffic to be managed easily.
Keep Data Secure Buily in security features like encryption and access control protect data. Additional protections like antivirus software, firewalls, and malware protection can be added to strenghten network security.
