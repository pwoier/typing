Ephemeral infrastructure: Dynamic inventory
In many circumstances, static inventories are adequate for describing your infrastructure. When working on small applications, low traffic web applications, individual workstations, its simple enough to manage an inventory file by hand.
However, in the age of cloud computing and highly scalable application architecture, its often necessary to add dozens or hundreds of servers to an infrastructure in a short period of time or to add and remove servers continuously, to scaleas traffic grows and subsides. In this circumstance, it would be tedious if not impossible to manage a single inventory file by hand, especially if youre using auto scaling infrastructure new instances are provisioned and need to be configured in minutes or seconds.
Even in the case of container based infrastructure, new instances need to be configured correctly, with the proper port mappings, application settings, and filesystem configuration.
For these situations, Ansible allows you to define inventory dynamically. If youre using one of the larger cloud based hosting providers, chances are there is already a dynamic inventory script which Ansible uses to build an inventory for you to use. Ansible core already includes scripts for Amazon Web Services, Cobbler, DigitalOcean, Linode, OpenStack, and other large providers, and later well explore creating our own dynamic inventory script if you arent using one of the major hosting providers or cloud management platforms.
