although most paragraphs should have a topic sentence, there are a few situations when a paragraph might not need a topic sentence. for example, you might be able to omit a topic sentence in a paragraph that narrates a series of events. if a paragraph countinues developing an idea that you introduced with a topic sentence in the previous paragraph or if all the sentences and details in a paragraph clearly refer perhaps indirectly to a main point. the vast majority of your paragraphs, however, should have a topic sentence.
