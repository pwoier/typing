What is a Port Scanner
A port scanner is a program that is used in network security testing and troubleshooting. An online port scanner is a scan that is able to externally test your network firewall and open ports because it is sourced from an extarnal IP address. It is powered by a simple port scanner program that is hosted on another system usually with an easy to use web interface. To understand what a port scanner does we need to first understand the basics of how the network works. In referencing the network this could be a local area netwok in your home or office or it could be the Internet. A network is compromised of systems with addresses and on those systems you have services. The address is called an IP Address and the Service could be many things but is basically software that is running on the system and accessible over the network on a port number. It could be a web server, email server or gaming server.
