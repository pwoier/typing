a well organized paragraph supports or develops a single controlling idea, which is expressed in a sentence called the topic sentence. a topic sentence has several important functions; it substantiates or supports an essays thesis statement; it unifies the content of a paragraph and directs the order of sentences; and it adbises the reader of the subject to be discussed and how the paragraph will disuss it. readers generally look to the first few sentences in a paragraph to determine the subject and perspective of the paragraph. thats why its often best to put the topic sentence at the very beginning of the paragraph. in some cases, however, its more effective to place another sentence before the topic sentence for example, a sentence linking the current paragraph to the pervious one, or one providing background information.
