The first configuration to be performed on any new server especially any server with any exposure direct or indirect to the public Internet is security configuration.
There are nine basic measures to ensure servers are secure from unauthorized access or intercepted communications:
Use secure and encrypted communication.
Disable root login and use sudo.
Remove unused software, open only required ports.
Use the principle of least privilege.
Update the OS and installed software.
Use a properly configured firewall.
Make sure log files are populated and rotated.
Monitor logins and block suspect IP addresses.
Use SELinux Security Enhanced Linux.
