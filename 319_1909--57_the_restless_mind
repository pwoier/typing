The scientist's desk was littered with notebooks pages scribbled with half formed ideas, equations left unfinished, and diagrams that resembled both machines and dreams. His name was Arav, though is the quiet solitude of his study, he often felt nameless, as if the identity "scientist" had swallowed everything else.
He had spent decades searching for patterns. Patterns in the stars, in the trembling of atoms, in the erratic behavior of Homo sapiens. He called them "subjects," though he knew they were his kin brothers and sisters stumbling through the same labyrinth of existence.

That word, which hovered at the edge of his mind, was enlightenment.
He had read of sages, mystics,
