If you run the same playbook again, it should report no changes the entire playbook is idempotent You might be starting to see just how powerful it is to have a tool as flexible as Ansible at your disposal; not only can you configure severs, you can create them singly, or dozens at a time, and configure them at once. And even if a harm fisted sysadmin jumps in and deletes an entire server, you can run the playbook again, and rest assured you server will be recreated and reconfigured exactly as it was when it was first set up.
Note that you might need to diable strict host key checking to get provisioning and instant configuration to work correctly end, otherwise you may run into an error stating that Ansible cant connect to the new droplet during the second play. To do this, add the line host key checking False under the defaults section in your ansible cfg file located in etc ansible by default.
You should normally leave host key checking enabled, but when rapidly building and destroying VMs for testing purposes, it is simplest to display it temporarily.
