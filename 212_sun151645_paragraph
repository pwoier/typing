which would run much faster as
Not much you may consider the OS has to load up the bin grep executable, which is a reasonably small bytes on my system open a pipe in memory for the transfer load and run the bin cat excutable, which is an even smaller bytes on my system attach it to the input of the pipe, and let it run.
Of course this kind of thing is what the OS is there over, the saving of not locating and loading the cat executable, setting up and releasing the pipe, can make some difference, especially in, say, a CGI environment where there are enough other factors to slow things down without the script itself being too much of a hurdle. Some Unices are more efficient than others at what they call building up and tearing down processes i.e. loading them up, executing them, and clearing them away again. But however good your flavour of Unix is at doing this, itd rather not have to do it at all.
As a result of this, you may hear mention of the Useless Use of Cat Award UUoC also known is some circles as The Award For The Most Gratitous Use Of The Word Cat In A Serious shell script being bandied about on the comp.unix.shell newsgroup from time to time. This is purely a way of peers keeping each other in check, and making sure that things are done right.
Which leads me nicely on to something else. Dont ever feel too close to your own shell scripts.
