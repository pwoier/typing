I hear you constipation and low mood can really weigh you down. Let's take it step by step
For constipation relief right now
Drink a glass of warn water slowly. Sometimes even just hydrating helps.
Move around a bit light walking or gentle stretching can stimulate the bowels.
Try eating something fibrous and easy, like papaya, banana, or soaked raisns.
For the emotional heaviness
Put on some calming music you said before music helps you study, it can lift your mood too.
Take slow breaths, really letting the exhale be longer. This can ease both body and mind.
Remind yourself this is temporary, both the constipation and emotional dip.
Do you want me to give you a quick one minute routine that can help both digestion and mood at the same time?
